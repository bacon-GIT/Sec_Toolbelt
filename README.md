# EnumerationTools
## Tools for recon on domains and servers

### ExifScraper
This almost works, but at the moment I'm having some trouble with downloading the files.

BUT what it WILL do is give Exif data on all JPG's (hopefully other file types in the future) on a particular webpage. 
Right now it does give exif data on a JPG though so it's worth having in the Toolbelt

### Get-HostInfo
A very useful rubber-ducky esque script that swipes a bunch of host info. Currently, it returns:
*	WiFi Passwords in plaintext
*	Drives, available space and whether or not they're encrypted
*	TCP connections
*	Other misc host info

#### Got some lines from: https://chrishales.wordpress.com/2018/01/03/powershell-password-one-liners/

### Move-SSH
Moves your ssh port in SELinux to a different port, forwards all existing port 22 traffic to a Cowrie honeypot port

### SubScanner 
Scan a domain for the instance of up to 10,000 subdomains and return all of the connected domains

#### Dependencies
*	requests

Domains from: https://github.com/danielmiessler/RobotsDisallowed


### BlackListCheck
Checks a list of IP's against a variety of blacklists, then uploads results into a pretty json file. 
Working on adding more blacklists to check against, but for now it checks AbuseIPDB and SpamCop.
There is also a section for VirusTotal that is being worked on ATM, but you need a premo API key for that.


### BannerYank
#### About
Banner Yank is a banner grab attack aggregator WIP.
As of now, BannerYank performs the following recon attacks:
*	Telnet
*	Wget
*	Curl
*	Nmap
*	Dmitry
*	WhatWeb

#### Dependencies
All of the tools mentioned in the above section

#### TO DO LIST
My goals for the future of this application are to build on the potential possibilities it provides as a
vulnerability scanner. This includes:
*	Adding more tools
*	Increasing the verbosity of the program
*	Being able to spot and report on common vulnerabilities found during banner grabs
		*	And creating a system for reporting these vulnerabilites
*	Overall just making the application more useful

#### Notes
As of now, the application operates as a simple OSINT tool. Use it as a stoneturner, it will help when you're
unsure if you've checked everything.
